# First Repo

## Purpose

This homework assignment will:

- Teach you how to add jQuery to your page
- Teach you how to add variables to your JS file
- How to use variables
- Write a function
- Interact with HTML elements with jQuery

## Task

For this homework assignment, you will:

- You must create a project named homework-eight.
- Create a navigation bar that has four links
- Add content to the page when you click on a link by using jQuery
- Use only one page and load all the content onto that page
- All pages must have full content. Images and text on every page and professionally styled.
- Upload your project to Github and Web4 and add your Web4 link to the README file. 


I used the midterm as the baseline for this homework-eight. As such, there are 4 HTML pages, but only one is used in the browser (index.html). The others have all content commented out to confirm that.
