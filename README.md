## Task

For this homework assignment, you will:

- Add content to the page when you click on a link by using MVC model and jQuery

I used the midterm as the baseline for this homework-eight. As such, there are 4 HTML pages, but only one is used in the browser (index.html). The others have all content commented out to confirm that.
